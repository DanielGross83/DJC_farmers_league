# DJC_farmers_league
NU Data Journalism Collective project on determining which European soccer leagues are 'farmer's leagues'

One Notebook was developed by Daniel Gross, the other notebook by Owen Handelman, both with extensive collaboration.

Web scaping and presentation were done together. See our "final presentation" file for our completed visualizations and analysis. 

Feel free to use our dataset for your own projects, although be warned that most of the leagues changed their points systems multiple times in their history and therefore adjustments must be made to accomodate for this in calculations.
